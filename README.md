# CS221: Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques

## Content

**What is this course about?** What do web search, speech recognition, face recognition, machine translation, autonomous driving, and automatic scheduling have in common? These are all complex real-world problems, and the goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to tackle these with rigorous mathematical tools. In this course, you will learn the foundational principles that drive these applications and practice implementing some of these systems. Specific topics include machine learning, search, game playing, Markov decision processes, constraint satisfaction, graphical models, and logic. The main goal of the course is to equip you with the tools to tackle new AI problems you might encounter in life.

**Prerequisites**: This course is fast-paced and covers a lot of ground, so it is important that you have a solid foundation on both the theoretical and empirical fronts. You should have taken the following classes (or their equivalents):
- Programming (CS 106A, CS 106B, CS 107)
- Discrete math (CS 103)
- Probability (CS 109)

**Reading**: There is no required textbook for this class, and you should be able to learn everything from the lecture notes and homeworks. However, if you would like to pursue more advanced topics or get another perspective on the same material, here are some books:

- Russell and Norvig. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. A comprehensive reference for all the AI topics that we will cover.
- Koller and Friedman. Probabilistic Graphical Models. Covers factor graphs and Bayesian networks (this is the textbook for CS228).
- Sutton and Barto. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. Covers Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning. Available free online.
- Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. The elements of statistical learning. Covers machine learning. Available free online.
- Tsang. Foundations of constraint satisfaction. Covers constraint satisfaction problems. Available free online.

Bear in mind that some of these books can be quite dense and use different notation terminology, so it might take some effort to connect up with the material from class.

**Video Access Disclaimer**: Video cameras located in the back of the room will capture the instructor presentations in this course. For your convenience, you can access these recordings by logging into the course Canvas site. These recordings might be reused in other Stanford courses, viewed by other Stanford students, faculty, or staff, or used for other education and research purposes. Note that while the cameras are positioned with the intention of recording only the instructor, occasionally a part of your image or voice might be incidentally captured. If you have questions, please contact a member of the teaching team.
